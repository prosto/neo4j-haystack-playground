        "Idea to build Neo4j + Haystack integration came after investigation about representing legislation using Graphs with complex relationships between legal **documents**. In the context of semantic search of legal docs Graphs seemed like a natural choice as a way to effectively ground LLMs in RAG pipelines. At the time there were news about Neo4j introducing support for vector indexes. Haystack with its component based NLP framework appeared well structured and documented. I liked the idea of pipelines with components having well defined interfaces (e.g. input/output slots, document stores). I decided to build the integration and learn both technologies.\n"

        "2. `neo4j-haystack` library comes with a number of components:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - [Neo4jDocumentStore](https://prosto.github.io/neo4j-haystack/reference/neo4j_store/) -  Document store for Neo4j Database with support for dense retrievals using Vector Search Index, implements the required [Protocol](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/v2.0/docs/document-store#documentstore-protocol). Document properties are stored as graph nodes. Embeddings are stored as part of node properties along with the rest of attributes (including meta). `Neo4jDocumentStore` also provides additional methods to query embeddings and manage VectorIndex.\n",
        "  - [Neo4jEmbeddingRetriever](https://prosto.github.io/neo4j-haystack/reference/neo4j_retriever/#neo4j_haystack.components.neo4j_retriever.Neo4jEmbeddingRetriever) - is a typical [retriever component](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/v2.0/docs/retrievers) which can be used to query vector store index and find related Documents. The component uses `Neo4jDocumentStore` to query embeddings.\n",
        "  - [Neo4jDynamicDocumentRetriever](https://prosto.github.io/neo4j-haystack/reference/neo4j_retriever/#neo4j_haystack.components.neo4j_retriever.Neo4jDynamicDocumentRetriever) is also a retriever component in a sense that it can be used to query Documents in Neo4j. However it is decoupled from `Neo4jDocumentStore` and allows to run arbitrary [Cypher query](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/queries/) to extract documents. Practically it is possible to query Neo4j same way `Neo4jDocumentStore` does, including vector search.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The `neo4j-haystack` library uses [Python Driver](https://neo4j.com/docs/api/python-driver/current/api.html#api-documentation) and\n",
        "[Cypher Queries](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/introduction/) to interact with Neo4j database and hide all complexities under the hood. In particular [Neo4jClient](https://prosto.github.io/neo4j-haystack/reference/neo4j_client/) ia acting as a data access layer and is handling all interactions with database by invoking Cypher queries.\n",
        "4. In Neo4j [Vector search index](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes-for-vector-search/) is being used for storing document embeddings and dense retrievals.\n",
